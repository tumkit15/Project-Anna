# Project-Anna
_Anna is written in Python 3 and uses Google's speech to text API. Anna can respond to basic 
instruction, search content on Wikipedia but its major power comes from the Wolfram alpha API which 
makes it powerful enough to answer questions like “what is the meaning of life” which apparently is 42._

## Setup:- 
 pip install speech_recognition as sr
 pip install time
 pip install gtts 
 pip install wikipedia
 pip install wolframalpha

### Usage :- 
**./annna.sh**
